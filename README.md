# ChatApp (ASP.NET Core 6.0)

Welcome to ChatApp! This is a real-time chat application developed using ASP.NET Core 6.0. The app allows users to join an open chat room by providing their name through a WebSocket connection. Users can then exchange messages in real-time with other participants in the chat room.
